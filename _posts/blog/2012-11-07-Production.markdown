"Open Source Libre Software" is the keyword you need. We are encouraged to believe "Special" computers are a requierement for quality art production. This is untrue. Fancy workstations with media hype are over priced regular PC computers. Artists want results. These can be obtained using a Linux distribution, turning any PC computer to a MasterCalculator. And linux is free. There is in particular one distribution that we <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommend: <a href="http://ubuntustudio.org" target="_blank">http://ubuntustudio.org.</a> It comes packed with all the software you need for a creative studio. And everything is legaly free. It runs on all modern computers, including your favorit McBanana.
